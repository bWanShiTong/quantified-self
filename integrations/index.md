# Integrations

When integration is created/requested/having issues table bellow should be updated, also if there was software update that breaks something device info should be updated. Structure should be `${DEVICE_TYPE}/${DEVICE_NAME}.md`, so for Whoop 4.0 it would be `fitness_bands/whoop4.0.md`, for Galaxy Watch 4 it would be `smart_watch/galaxy-watch4.0.md`, for mi composition scale 2 it would be `body_scales/mi-composition-scale2.md`.
